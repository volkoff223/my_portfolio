      My passion for writing code started in 2015 when I to learn the basics of
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I found it fascinating that there were so many
      free resources on the internet and began to learn as much as I could. This
      would lead me to enrolling in college and obtaining my Associate’s degree
      in web publishing and eventually earning my Bachelor of Science degree in
      Information Technology. I am still as passionate about software
      development now as I was when I first started. I have continued my
      education through free and paid programs such as FreeCodeCamp and Udemy.

      I joined the Navy straight out of high school and I’ve had a very exciting
      career from driving patrol boats in Iraq to teaching survival skills at
      the Navy’s SERE (Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape) school and
      working on the latest geolocation tools for the Navy SEALs at DEVGRU
      (Naval Special Warfare Development Group). I have fulfilled all of my
      goals in the Navy and I am now ready to move on to my next adventure.

      I currently live in Chesapeake, VA with my wife of 21 years and my three
      beautiful children. When I am not writing code or solving coding
      challenges I spend a lot of time on my boat with the family. I also like
      to polish my skills as an novice horticulturist and self taught auto
      mechanic.
