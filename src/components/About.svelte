      I am a Linux and containerization enthusiast with a strong focus on Red
      Hat Enterprise Linux, Kubernetes, and OpenShift. My passion lies in
      automating complex infrastructure and enabling scalable, reliable
      application delivery through modern DevOps practices. Over the years, I’ve
      developed deep expertise in system administration, container
      orchestration, and CI/CD automation, and I enjoy building solutions that
      reduce manual effort while improving security and performance.

      My career began in the U.S. Navy, where I gained over two decades of
      experience in high-pressure, mission-critical environments. From operating
      patrol boats in Iraq to teaching survival skills at SERE school, and later
      supporting advanced geolocation platforms for Naval Special Warfare, I
      learned the importance of precision, resilience, and continuous
      improvement—qualities I now apply to every technical challenge.

      Today I live in Chesapeake, VA with my wife and three children. When I’m
      not exploring the latest in Linux, Kubernetes, or cloud automation, you’ll
      often find me on the water with my family, experimenting with
      horticulture, or turning a wrench as a self-taught auto mechanic.
